Differential calculus is\\napplied to model situations in science and engineering that involve\\noscillations. Integral calculus is used to solve selected problems involving\\nfirst- and second-order differential equations, and to calculate areas,\\nvolumes, lengths and other physical quantities. Vectors, matrix multiplication\\nand determinants are introduced and applied to problem-solving and modelling.\\nSequences and series are reviewed and power series introduced where power\\nseries are used to approximate more functions.\\nSubject learning objectives (SLOs)\\nUpon successful completion of this subject students should be able to:\\n\\n| Describe the relevance of mathematics to engineering and science and the role which engineering and science play in the development and evolution of mathematical ideas and methods | 2. | Apply mathematical tools and resources to model real world problems, especially in engineering and science | 3. | Demonstrate correct use of mathematical terminology and concepts, and show understanding of those concepts by describing them in both formal and informal language. | 4. | Achieve a high level of skill in the mathematical techniques covered in the subject content | 5. | Communicate mathematical knowledge clearly, logically and critically. | 6. | Use appropriate mathematical software to perform calculations and explore mathematical ideas relevant to the subject content, and demonstrate knowledge of the functions of this software by interpreting output.\\n\\nCourse intended learning outcomes (CILOs)\\nThis subject also contributes specifically to the development of following\\ncourse intended learning outcomes:\\n\\nTechnically Proficient: FEIT graduates apply abstraction, mathematics and discipline fundamentals, software, tools and techniques to evaluate, implement and operate systems. (D.1)\\nCollaborative and Communicative: FEIT graduates work as an effective member or leader of diverse teams, communicating effectively and operating within cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural contexts in the workplace. (E.1)\\n\\nContribution to the development of graduate attributes\\nEngineers Australia Stage 1 Competencies This subject contributes to the\\ndevelopment of the following Engineers Australia Stage 1 Competencies:\\n\\n1.2 Conceptual understanding of the mathematics, numerical analysis, statistics, and computer and information sciences which underpin the engineering discipline.\\n3.2. Effective oral and written communication in professional and lay domains.\\n\\nThis subject is fundamental for Mathematics and Science students as it\\nintroduces them and contributes to the development of the most important\\ncharacteristics of the modern scientist. It enables them to understand and\\napply fundamental mathematical principals to scientific theories and\\nmethodologies, to use problem-solving techniques, and to approach scientific\\nchallenges systematically. Furthermore, it helps them ensure that their work\\naligns with professional standards and ethical guidelines, and enables them to\\nefficiently communicate scientific findings. This subject contributes to the\\ndevelopment of the following graduate attributes: Graduate Attribute 1 -\\nDisciplinary knowledge A broad introduction to the most important and widely\\nused concepts in mathematics is given. Graduate Attribute 2 - Research,\\ninquiry and critical thinking Throughout the subject mathematics is\\npresented as a tool, which students are invited to use in the solution to\\nreal-world problems Graduate Attribute 3 - Professional, ethical and social\\nresponsibility Throughout the subject mathematics is presented as a tool,\\nwhich students are invited to use in the solution to real-world problems\\nGraduate Attribute 5 - Communication Students will use formal and informal\\nlanguage to communicate knowledge clearly, logically and critically.\\nTeaching and learning strategies\\nLectures: Students are expected to review the pre-recorded lecture material\\n(of about 2-3 hours per week). Blank slides of the lecture sheets will be made\\navailable, and students are encouraged to make their own notes. Tutorials:\\nTutorials will be held weekly on campus, with a duration of 2 hours. Skills\\nDevelopment Tests will be held in the tutorial, with feedback given the\\nfollowing week. In the tutorials, students may be required to work in groups,\\nas discussion of mathematical ideas helps students to learn. Students will be\\nworking through problems with the assistance of the tutor, who may also\\ndemonstrate mathematical modelling techniques and mathematical programming\\nwhich the students can then investigate themselves. Students will get more\\nvalue from the tutorials if they have attempted all tutorial problems before\\nattending the tutorials. Lectures may be supplemented by a live, on campus\\nworkshop to answer student questions.\\nContent (topics)\\nVectors and their application to physical problems. Functions and their\\nrelationship to measurement and the interpretation of physical results.\\nTrigonometric functions and inverse trigonometric functions. Inverse\\nfunctions. Hyperbolic functions. Differentiation. Integrals and methods of\\nintegration. Complex numbers. Differential equations arising from physical\\nproblems. Oscillatory motion. Matrix multiplication and determinants.\\nSequences and series, power series including Taylor series.\\nAssessment\\nAssessment task 1: Skills Development Tests\\n| Intent: | These short tests (10 in total, of equal weighting) will provide regular feedback on how students are mastering the necessary skills in each area of the subject. They will be held in the tutorial classes according to the schedule. \\n---|---\\nObjective(s): |  This assessment task addresses subject learning objective(s): 2, 4 and 5  This assessment task contributes to the development of course intended learning outcome(s): D.1 and E.1 \\nType: | Quiz/test\\nGroupwork: | Individual\\nWeight: |  60% \\nLength: | 30 minutes.\\nCriteria: | Students will be assessed and given feedback on:\\n\\nThe ability to use key mathematical concepts in their appropriate context\\nThe ability to obtain the correct solution to problems\\nClear communication of how they arrived at the solution, including all steps\\n\\nAssessment task 2: Final Examination\\nIntent: |  The final examination is a test of the core competency in mathematical skills developed throughout this subject.\\n---|---\\nObjective(s): |  This assessment task addresses subject learning objective(s): 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6  This assessment task contributes to the development of course intended learning outcome(s): D.1 and E.1 \\nType: | Examination\\nGroupwork: | Individual\\nWeight: |  40% \\nLength: | Allow 2 Hours to complete the exam.
